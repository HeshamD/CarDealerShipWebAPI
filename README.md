Car DealerShip Web API


Api stands for Application Programming Interface, which it's a set of functions that allows the application to access data and interact with external software components
operating systems, or microservices.

>> Benefits of using APIs
# Security: While using an API, client-side and server-side application works independently, and they communicate through API, so if anyone tries to hack into the client-side app, the server stays unaffected and secured.

Flexibility: APIs allow content to be embedded from any site or application more easily. For e.g. an API written in GO can be used by Node.js/Django.

Efficiency: When access is provided to an API, the content generated can be published automatically and is available for every channel. It allows it to be shared and distributed more easily.

Innovation: With an API, an application layer can be created which can be used to distribute information and services to new audiences which can be personalized to create custom user experiences.
